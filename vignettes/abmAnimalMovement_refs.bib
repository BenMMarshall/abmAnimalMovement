	abstract = {Animal movement is a complex spatiotemporal phenomenon that has intrigued researchers from many disciplines. Interactions among animals, and between animals and the environments that they traverse, play an important role in the development of the complex ecological and social systems in which they are embedded. Agent-based models have been increasingly applied as a computa- tional approach to the study of animal movement across landscapes. In this article, we present a review of agent-based models in which the simulation of animal movement processes and patterns is the central theme. Our discussion of these processes is focused on four key components: internal states, external factors, motion capacities, and navigation capacities. These four components have been identified in the emerging movement ecology research paradigm and are important for mod- eling animal movement behavior. Because agent-based models allow for an individual-based approach that encapsulates these four components, the underlying processes that drive animal behavior can be deeply explored using this technique. A set of challenges and issues remain, how- ever, for agent-based models of animal movement. In this article, we review the existing literature and identify potential research directions that could help address these challenges. Introduction},

	abstract = {The status signalling hypothesis aims to explain within-species variation in ornamentation by suggesting that some ornaments signal dominance status. Here, we use multilevel meta-analytic models to challenge the textbook example of this hypothesis, the black bib of male house sparrows (Passer domesticus). We conducted a systematic review, and obtained primary data from published and unpublished studies to test whether dominance rank is positively associated with bib size across studies. Contrary to previous studies, the overall effect size (i.e. meta-analytic mean) was small and uncertain. Furthermore, we found several biases in the literature that further question the support available for the status signalling hypothesis. We discuss several explanations including pleiotropic, population- and context-dependent effects. Our findings call for reconsidering this established textbook example in evolutionary and behavioural ecology, and should stimulate renewed interest in understanding within-species variation in ornamental traits.
          ,
            Many bird species have colourful, intricately patterned plumage. This ornamentation is generally believed to exist to attract partners. In the 1970s, however, scientists proposed an alternative idea, called the ‘status signalling hypothesis'. This suggests that some birds have plumage ornaments that indicate the fighting abilities or dominance status of their bearers, much like the military badges worn by humans. These badges of status might evolve because fights, which commonly determine who gets valuable resources such as food, are a risky business. Individuals would greatly benefit from being able to predict the fighting abilities of any potential competitor and so avoid fights that they will probably lose.
            Male house sparrows have a black patch on their throat, known as the bib, that has been considered to be a textbook demonstration of the status signalling hypothesis. However, most of the studies that support this idea studied small numbers of birds and used inconsistent methods. Furthermore, some recent studies have failed to replicate previous findings.
            Sánchez-Tójar et al. collected data from several house sparrow populations across the world and systematically scrutinized the published literature to find all of the studies that tested the status signalling hypothesis in house sparrows. This revealed only weak evidence that the bib of male house sparrows signals the fighting abilities of its bearer. Instead, the published literature is a biased subsample; failures to replicate the hypothesis likely remain unpublished.
            Currently, failures to replicate previous findings are generally deemed uninteresting, and so are not often published. By demonstrating the need to replicate findings robustly to avoid biasing conclusions, Sánchez-Tójar et al. thus join the call for a change in incentives and scientific culture.},
