# TO DO -------------------------------------------------------------------

## Add custom input for size of shelter site (ie distance where rest behaviour
# becomes near stationary)

## Add system for points of avoidance, i.e. shelter site attraction in reverse

## Add a system for a second cycling, e.g. hibernation or snake digestion cycle

## Expand range of rasters

## Ensure that each raster is connected to correct behaviour. Movement vs
# decisions
