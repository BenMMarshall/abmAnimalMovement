# TO DO -------------------------------------------------------------------

## Expand range of rasters

## Ensure that each raster is connected to correct behaviour. Movement vs
# decisions

## tidy up sub-functions into a single header file (C++)

###### THERE IS A POSSIBLE ISSUE WITH THE FIRST SET OF OPTIONS step 0

###### FIX over turning thing where -360 should be -180 each step (i think)

# NOTES -------------------------------------------------------------------

## destination/perceptual range
# k_desRange
# s_desRange
# mu_desDir
# k_desDir


## AVOIDANCE notes
# mO = moveoptions interator
#
# x_avoidPoints = vec of points
# y_avoidPoints = vec of points
# navp = number of points to avoid, comes from x_avoidPoints
#
# cumulative_dist = sum of distances for each moveOption, used once per loop
#
# distance_toAvoid = vec of the cum. distances for each moveOption
#
# haven't added anything about the avoidance only being in certain behaviours

## SCEOND CYCLE NOTES

## inputs
# secondCycle = BOOL

# secondary_Cycle_A
# secondary_Cycle_M
# secondary_Cycle_PHI
# secondary_Cycle_TAU

## derived
# b0_secondaryMod
