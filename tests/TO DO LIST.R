# TO DO -------------------------------------------------------------------

## Add custom input for size of shelter site (ie distance where rest behaviour
# becomes near stationary)

## Expand range of rasters

## Ensure that each raster is connected to correct behaviour. Movement vs
# decisions

# NOTES -------------------------------------------------------------------

## AVOIDANCE notes
# mO = moveoptions interator
#
# x_avoidPoints = vec of points
# y_avoidPoints = vec of points
# navp = number of points to avoid, comes from x_avoidPoints
#
# cumulative_dist = sum of distances for each moveOption, used once per loop
#
# distance_toAvoid = vec of the cum. distances for each moveOption
#
# haven't added anything about the avoidance only being in certain behaviours

## SCEOND CYCLE NOTES

## inputs
# secondCycle = BOOL

# secondary_Cycle_A
# secondary_Cycle_M
# secondary_Cycle_PHI
# secondary_Cycle_TAU

## derived
# b0_secondaryMod
