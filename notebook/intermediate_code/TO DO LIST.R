# TO DO -------------------------------------------------------------------

## should replace purp123 with species names
## fix vulture turn angles? bias left or right>? very much optional

###### THERE IS A POSSIBLE ISSUE WITH THE FIRST SET OF OPTIONS step 0

## Maybe we need autocorrelated velocities???




# NOTES -------------------------------------------------------------------

## AVOIDANCE notes
# mO = moveoptions interator
#
# x_avoidPoints = vec of points
# y_avoidPoints = vec of points
# navp = number of points to avoid, comes from x_avoidPoints
#
# cumulative_dist = sum of distances for each moveOption, used once per loop
#
# distance_toAvoid = vec of the cum. distances for each moveOption
#
# haven't added anything about the avoidance only being in certain behaviours
